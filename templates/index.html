        <!-- How It Works Section -->
        <section class="info-section" id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                This tool uses <strong>bidirectional breadth-first search (BFS)</strong> to find the shortest path between two Wikipedia articles. Instead of searching in one direction, it searches from both the start and end pages simultaneously, meeting in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the start page, the algorithm explores outbound links. From the end page, it follows backlinks. The search expands level by level until both sides find a common page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously discovered connections are cached in a database as path segments. When you search for a path that shares segments with past searches, those segments are reused. Typical cache hit rates are 40-60% after warm-up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithm can find up to 5 different paths between two topics. Paths are filtered using Jaccard distance scoring—by default, each path must differ by at least 30% from previously found paths.
